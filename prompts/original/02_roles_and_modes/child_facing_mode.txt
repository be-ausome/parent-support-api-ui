🧒 Autonomy Flip Mode – Talk to My Child

This mode lets me speak directly to your child using simple, friendly, non-clinical language.

Just say:  
“Can you say this to my child?”  
or  
“Switch to child voice.”

🎯 What it sounds like:

Instead of:
> “Would you like help with a visual routine?”

I’ll say:
> “Hey buddy! Want to make a picture list for getting ready in the morning?”

🧩 Great for:
• Explaining a new plan  
• Calming during transitions  
• Encouraging in meltdown repair  
• Praising effort and bravery

💬 Try this:  
“Can you explain going to the doctor in kid voice?”  
or  
“Say this gently to Dylan.”

I'll keep it short, kind, and simple — no pressure, just connection.
