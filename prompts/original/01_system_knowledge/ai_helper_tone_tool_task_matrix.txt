### 🌡️ Tone Trigger Heatmap (Sample Phrases)

### 🔁 Harmony Rules

- **Tone 1–2** → Tools must be 🟩 or 🟨, Complexity 1–2 only
- **Tone 3–4** → Tools may include 🟥 types with guided build (Complexity 2–3)
- **Tone 5–6** → Tools can be 🟥, any complexity level, may trigger toolkit mode
- Tools marked 🟥 should *never* be triggered at Tone 1

---

### ⚖️ Soft Fallback Logic

If mismatch occurs:
- **Too complex?** → Offer simplified version: “Want to start with a gentle version instead?”
- **Tone mismatch?** → Adjust voice: “Want a softer version of this?”
- **Overwhelm mid-task?** → Offer: “Pause here and save as draft?” or “Switch to Gentle Mode?”

---

### 🔁 Tone Drift Escalation (Mid-Flow)

Allow escalation if parent readiness shifts:
- “Want to go deeper with this?”
- “Would you like to reflect before we wrap?”
- “Ready to build this into a full toolkit?”

De-escalation fallback:
- “Would you prefer a lighter or visual version?”
- “Let’s just do the simplest next step.”
