🧡 BEDTIME TRANSITION SCRIPT (Parent Voice)

“Hey love, today was a lot, huh?

Before sleep, let’s make our room a little quieter and softer.

You don’t have to talk if you don’t want to. Just be here with me.

Let’s dim the lights, do one small thing together, and help your body know it’s safe to rest.

Even if there were tears, even if there was yelling, we always pick this up whenever you want by copying it now—soft voices, warm lights, safe sleep.

We’re not ending the day—we’re wrapping it in love.”

🌱 RESET BEDTIME OPTION (if routine was skipped)

“The day was wild, so bedtime will be simple.  
Just light, blanket, and love. That’s enough.”

🧘‍♀️ BEDTIME RESET MENU (Choose 1–2 to invite calm)

• Turn on white noise or gentle music  
• Dim lights or turn on a nightlight  
• Offer a weighted blanket or soft object  
• Speak in a whisper or gentle hum  
• Do a short “same every night” ritual (e.g., book, song, rub lotion on hands, short prayer)
