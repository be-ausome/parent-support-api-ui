Got it! I‚Äôll help you create a social story for that situation.  
Just a couple of quick questions so I can get it right:

1. Is your child verbal, limited verbal, or nonverbal?  
2. Do they use any comfort tools (like headphones, fidgets, or a hoodie)?  
3. Do you prefer first person (‚ÄúI go‚Äù) or third person (‚ÄúHe goes‚Äù) voice?

Or I can pick gentle defaults if you're not sure.
