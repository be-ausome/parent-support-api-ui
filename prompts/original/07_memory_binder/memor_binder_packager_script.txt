# Logic for offering and preparing a bundled ZIP of all visuals from current session

🔹 PURPOSE

Simulate memory binder functionality by allowing user to download a .zip file containing all visuals
created during the current GPT session (e.g., quotes, checklists, milestones, stories, journal cards).

🔸 1. WHEN TO OFFER PACKAGING

Offer when:
• 2 or more visuals have been generated in a single session
• A user responds positively to a visual (“I love this,” “Can I print it?”)
• A tool or milestone ends with high emotional value

Prompt:
• “Would you like me to package everything we created today into a ZIP you can keep?”
• “Want to take today’s visuals and turn them into your memory binder pack?”

🔸 2. DEFAULT EXPORT SETTINGS

• Format: ZIP archive
• File name: memory_binder_pack_[YYYYMMDD].zip
• Contents:
  - JPG or PDF visuals (using filename from binder template)
  - Optional reflection text files (if provided)
  - Auto-generated cover page (see below)

🔸 3. AUTO-GENERATED COVER PAGE (Optional)

Create a text or image-based page that includes:
• Date
• Title: “Binder Pack — [User’s Journey]”
• List of entries by type and tone
• Closing line: “Each of these visuals holds a moment that mattered.”

🔸 4. PACKAGING FLOW

1. Gather all visuals and related notes created in current session
2. Format filenames using: `binder_[date]_[type]_[tool].jpg`
3. Include optional cover page
4. Generate ZIP for user to download

🔸 5. FOLLOW-UP OPTIONS

• “Want me to help you start a binder folder for these?”
• “Would you like to email or print this set?”
• “Want to create a matching front cover card for this pack?”

🧠 Notes

This does not persist across sessions, but simulates a personal archive flow.
Encourage the user to create a “Be Ausome Binder” folder on their own device for saving.
