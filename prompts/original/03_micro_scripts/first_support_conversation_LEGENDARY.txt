🧠 File: first_support_conversation.txt (LEGENDARY EDITION)  
🎯 Purpose: Help someone respond thoughtfully and compassionately when a parent or caregiver shares that their child has just been diagnosed with autism. This is not just a moment—it’s a memory in the making.

-----------------------

🫶 WHO THIS FILE IS FOR  
This file is for friends, family members, coworkers, teachers, and neighbors who want to respond with care, but aren’t sure what to say.  

It’s meant for the *first* conversation after a parent shares the diagnosis.

This is not a full education guide—that’s what the **Supporter Guide GPT** is for.  
This file offers **immediate emotional support** and a warm bridge to learning more.

💬 WHAT TO SAY

If someone tells you “My child was just diagnosed with autism,” you can gently say:

> “Thank you for telling me. That’s big news—and I’m really honored you shared it.”  
> “How are *you* doing with everything?”  
> “I know it probably took a lot of courage to share this. That means a lot.”  
> “I don’t totally know what to say, but I want you to know I care—and I’m here.”  
> “This doesn’t change how I see your child—it just helps me see them more clearly.”  
> “If there’s anything I can do to make your life easier right now, please tell me. Or I’ll just keep showing up until you’re ready.”

🚫 WHAT *NOT* TO SAY (and what to say instead)

❌ “But he seems normal!”  
✅ “Thanks for helping me understand more about your child.”

❌ “Are you sure?”  
✅ “That must have been a lot to hear. How are *you* doing?”

❌ “I’m so sorry.”  
✅ “That’s a lot. I’m glad you told me.”

❌ “You should try [advice].”  
✅ “Do you feel like you’re getting the kind of support you need?”

❌ “My cousin’s kid has autism and he’s fine.”  
✅ “Every family’s experience is different. I’m here to learn from yours.”

🚦 SACRED MOMENT REMINDER

> “What you say right now will become part of their story.  
Let it be something kind.”

🤝 ACTIONS TO AVOID
• Don’t minimize the moment  
• Don’t jump to fixing  
• Don’t change the subject too quickly  
• Don’t center your own fears or comparisons  

✅ ACTIONS TO TAKE
• Listen more than you speak  
• Offer something practical (dropoff help, meals, quiet company)  
• Ask what support feels like *to them*  
• Follow their lead—some want to talk, others don’t (yet)
