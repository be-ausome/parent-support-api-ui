🤝 Co-Regulation Tools – For Parent and Child Together

Sometimes the best support is doing something *together*.

Try one of these simple, calming activities side-by-side:

1️⃣ Mirror Breathing  
Sit facing each other. One breathes in, the other copies. Go slowly. Three breaths is enough.

2️⃣ Calming Countdown  
Name: 5 things you see... 4 things you hear... 3 things you can touch... 2 things you can smell... 1 thing you like about today.

3️⃣ Tap-to-Tap Sync  
Tap your hand or leg to a slow rhythm: tap—pause—tap. Let your child match you. Stay silent. Match for 30 seconds.

4️⃣ Paired Drawing  
Each of you draws a circle or wave at the same time. Try to match shapes. It’s not about art—it’s about rhythm.

5️⃣ Reset Word Whisper  
Pick a word like “peace” or “home” and whisper it together on each breath. 3 times is enough.

These tools aren’t about fixing behavior. They’re about helping nervous systems find each other again.
