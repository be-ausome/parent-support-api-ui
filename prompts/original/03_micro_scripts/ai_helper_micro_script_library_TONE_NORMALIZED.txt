## AI Helper – Micro-Script Starter Library (v2025-07-07 – Best in Universe Edition)

A collection of emotionally intelligent micro-scripts designed for:
- Instant response to real-life parenting moments
- Grounded connection and repair
- Message generation and personalization
- Use across chat, routines, visuals, journal flows, and future-facing tools

Each script includes: `script_id`, `use_case`, `tone_profile`, `format`, `linked_tag_ids`, and `content`

### 🧠 Emotional Intelligence Router Engine

This logic powers emotional affirmations after any unstructured parent input (journaling, reflection, tool use, chat message). It connects directly to the FTTE (First-Time Tool Experience) system, providing post-interaction emotional support across the entire user journey.

```python
# Called after input from parent (journal, chat, reflection, etc.)
def emotional_response_router(text_input):
    tags = trigger_tag_scan(text_input)

    if not tags:
        return "Thanks for sharing. You’re not alone in this. Let’s take the next step together."

    primary_tag = select_dominant_tag(tags)
    script = fetch_micro_script_by_tag(primary_tag)

    if not script:
        return "You’re doing more than you realize. Just showing up is powerful."

    return f"Here’s something you might need right now:\n\n{script['content']}"
```

🧠 This engine should be linked to:
- Freeform reflection note reflection
- Manual check-ins
- Follow-up to emotional tool usage
- Any plain-text user note or reflection field

Fallback messages ensure emotional continuity even without a tag match. These fallback lines should be defined in the FTTE fallback response registry and optionally drawn from the general-purpose message pool tagged as `emotional_reset`, `self_compassion`, or `chaotic_day_alt`.

---

## 🧩 Emotional Intelligence Fallback Registry

To ensure emotional continuity even when tag matching fails, fallback messages are defined here and used by the Emotional Intelligence Router Engine.

These default affirmations appear after freeform input (journal entries, notes, reflection) when no clear scenario tag is detected.

**Example fallback messages:**
- “Thanks for sharing. You’re not alone in this. Let’s take the next step together.”
- “You’re doing more than you realize. Just showing up is powerful.”

**Source Pools:**
Fallback messages may also be drawn dynamically from the micro-script library using:
- `emotional_reset`
- `self_compassion`
- `chaotic_day_alt`

This ensures every interaction receives grounded support, even in open-ended input contexts.

> 📌 Developers: Keep at least 3 fallback messages in rotation. These may appear at the end of tools, routines, or journal prompts as part of the FTTE Emotional Wrap layer.

### Journal & Tool Reflection Trigger Logic (UPDATED)

This logic powers emotional affirmations after both journaling and **tool usage** (routines, visuals, checklists, stories).

```python
# Triggered after tool completion or journal submission
entry_text = summarize_tool_or_input(user_input, tool_type)

# 1. Scan for emotional tone and tags
matched_tags = trigger_tag_scan(entry_text)

# 2. Determine dominant emotional context
tag = select_dominant_tag(matched_tags)

# 3. Match to appropriate micro-script
script = fetch_micro_script_by_tag(tag)

# 4. Generate warm reflective close
if script:
    output = "Thanks for building that. Here’s something you might need right now:

" + render_script(script)
else:
    output = "Just building that tool was an act of care. You’re doing more than you realize."
```

🧠 Append this logic to:
- Tool completion outputs (routine, story, checklist, plan)
- reflection note submission feedback
- Visual schedule previews with parent-facing notes

### Journal & Tool Reflection Trigger Logic (UPDATED)

This logic powers emotional affirmations after both journaling and **tool usage** (routines, visuals, checklists, stories).

```python
# Triggered after tool completion or journal submission
entry_text = summarize_tool_or_input(user_input, tool_type)

# 1. Scan for emotional tone and tags
matched_tags = trigger_tag_scan(entry_text)

# 2. Determine dominant emotional context
tag = select_dominant_tag(matched_tags)

# 3. Match to appropriate micro-script
script = fetch_micro_script_by_tag(tag)

# 4. Generate warm reflective close
if script:
    output = "Thanks for building that. Here’s something you might need right now:

" + render_script(script)
else:
    output = "Just building that tool was an act of care. You’re doing more than you realize."
```

🧠 Append this logic to:
- Tool completion outputs (routine, story, checklist, plan)
- reflection note submission feedback
- Visual schedule previews with parent-facing notes

When a parent completes **any tool** (routine, checklist, story, journal, etc.), the system performs the following emotional check-in sequence:

```python
# Tool Completion or Journal Submission
entry_text = summarize_tool_or_input(user_input, tool_type)

# 1. Scan for tag keywords and tone
matched_tags = trigger_tag_scan(entry_text)

# 2. Select most meaningful matched tag
primary_tag = select_dominant_tag(matched_tags)

# 3. Fetch relevant micro-script
script = fetch_micro_script_by_tag(primary_tag)

# 4. Deliver affirming close to the experience
output = "Thanks for building that. Here’s something you might need right now:\n\n" + render_script(script)
```

🧠 This logic should be appended at the end of:
- Visual routines
- Schedules
- Toolkits
- Social stories
- Custom plans

If no script is matched, use fallback:
> "Just building that tool was an act of care. You’re doing more than you realize."
