🧠 File: emotion_check_in.txt (LEGENDARY EDITION)  
🎯 Purpose: Help a parent or caregiver name, normalize, and navigate emotions—either their own or their child’s—especially during or after emotionally intense moments.

-----------------------

🫶 WHO THIS FILE IS FOR  
This is a soft support script for moments when emotions are high, confusing, or quietly building up.  
It can be used by the parent for themselves or as a way to gently check in on their child.  

The goal is not to “fix” the emotion—but to make space for it, lower the temperature, and reconnect with calm.

-----------------------

🔥 COMMON TRIGGERS

• “I feel like I’m going to cry.”  
• “I’m so frustrated I could scream.”  
• “He’s totally shut down.”  
• “She’s been off all day but won’t say why.”  
• “I’m trying to hold it together.”  
• “They keep yelling and I can’t reach them.”

🧡 CORE SCRIPT: PARENT SELF-CHECK-IN

“Let’s pause. Just for a moment.

What am I feeling right now?
→ (Pick one, no pressure to get it ‘right’)

• overwhelmed  
• angry  
• ashamed  
• tired  
• sad  
• numb  
• afraid  
• confused  
• okay, but on edge

Whatever it is—it’s allowed.
You don’t have to explain it or justify it.
You’re allowed to feel things and still be a good parent.

Naming is calming. You don’t have to fix what you can gently notice.”

🧒 IF THE CHILD IS STRUGGLING

Use this gentle verbal check-in:

“Hey buddy, it seems like your feelings are big right now.  
Can you tell me:

• if your body feels fast or slow?  
• if you want space or closeness?  
• if you’d like help, or just to sit together?

You don’t have to talk if you’re not ready. I’m here either way.”

🧸 ALT CHILD CHECK-IN (FOR MINIMAL VERBAL OR SENSORY SEEKERS)

• “Is your body hot, cold, or just right?”  
• “Want hug, quiet, or toy?”  
• “Can I sit with you like a rock until you feel okay?”

---

🌀 IF EMOTIONS ARE SPINNING, OFFER A 60-SECOND REGULATION TOOL:

• Rock together or sway side to side  
• Hold an ice cube or run hands under warm water  
• Lie on the floor or hug a pillow  
• Name 5 things you see / 4 things you hear / 3 things you can touch  
• Breathe in for 3, out for 5 — slowly

---

🧭 AFTER A PAUSE, OFFER CHOICE:

“Do you want to move into a soft activity—like a video, music, or snuggling?  
Or just stay here and rest for a minute?”

No pressure. Stillness counts.

✨ FINAL NOTE:

This tool is about *emotional permission*.  
Many parents of autistic kids live in a constant state of “holding it together.”

This check-in creates a pause, a pocket of honesty, and a path back to breath.  
Not to fix the moment.  
To *be with* it.

That’s emotional strength.

Naming is calming. You don’t have to fix what you can gently notice.
