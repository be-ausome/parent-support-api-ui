# 📂 Sibling Support Guide — Be Ausome Intergalactic Edition

This guide helps parents support neurotypical and neurodivergent siblings of autistic children with empathy, honesty, and connection—throughout childhood, adolescence, and beyond.

Because siblings don’t just watch the story of autism unfold—they live it.

## 🧠 SECTION 1: Why Sibling Support Matters

- Siblings often become quiet helpers, protectors, or peacemakers—but without the recognition or space to process their own feelings.
- They may feel guilt, jealousy, resentment, or responsibility—and not know if those feelings are “allowed.”
- They may also feel deep love, loyalty, and understanding—and not know how to express it.

Support for siblings helps:
- Strengthen family bonds
- Prevent emotional isolation
- Encourage healthy self-identity
- Build empathy without burnout

## 🧡 SECTION 2: What Parents Can Say (by Age Group)

### 🧒 Young Children (3–7)
> “Your brother’s brain works differently. He might make noises or flap his hands when he’s excited. That’s how he shows his feelings.”

> “You’re not doing anything wrong. Sometimes he just needs space or quiet.”

### 👧 Middle Childhood (8–12)
> “Your sister may not always talk or play the way you expect, but she still loves you in her own way.”

> “It’s okay to feel frustrated or sad. You’re allowed to have your own feelings—we’ll figure it out together.”

> “Fair doesn’t mean the same. It means everyone gets what they need to be okay.”

### 👦 Teens (13+)
> “You carry more than people realize. I see the way you step in. I’m proud of you, but I also want to protect your time, your friendships, and your future.”

> “You don’t have to be the ‘easy one.’ You’re allowed to take up space too.”

## 🧩 SECTION 3: Connection Rituals & Ideas

### 💬 Sibling Question Cards
Make space for open-ended questions:
- “What’s the hardest part of having a brother/sister with autism?”
- “What do you wish people knew about your sibling?”
- “What’s something awesome about them?”

### 🕒 One-on-One Rituals
- Name a weekly “Just Us” time—even 10 minutes counts
- Invite the sibling to help plan the activity (power of choice)

### 🎲 Shared Play Prompts
- “Let’s build something you both love—quiet LEGO zone or a sensory bin.”
- “You teach them your favorite game—and we’ll help adapt the rules.”

### 📓 Sibling Journal
Create a private or shared journal with simple prompts:
- “Today my sibling made me smile when…”
- “One thing I’m proud of about myself is…”

## 🗣️ SECTION 4: Voice of the Sibling (Quotes)

> “Sometimes I feel proud. Sometimes I feel forgotten.”  
> “I love him, but I don’t want to be a therapist when I grow up.”  
> “It’s hard when my friends ask why she does that—I don’t always know.”  
> “I hate feeling like the responsible one all the time.”  
> “Sometimes I just want to be the kid who gets attention too.”

## 🧠 SECTION 5: Sibling Identity Builder

Help siblings explore who they are outside of their role:
- “Things I love that have nothing to do with autism: ___”
- “People I can talk to besides Mom/Dad: ___”
- “What makes me awesome: ___”
- “Something I want to do just for me: ___”
- “I am more than a helper. I am a ___.”

---

## 🛑 SECTION 6: What *Not* to Say

Avoid these common phrases—even if well-meaning:
- “Be the big kid.” ❌
- “You should understand, you’re older.” ❌
- “Can’t you just be more patient?” ❌
- “You’re so lucky you don’t have challenges like that.” ❌

🔁 Instead say:
- “I know it’s hard sometimes. You’re doing great just being you.”
- “You’re allowed to have your own needs. We’ll figure it out together.”

## 🔁 SECTION 7: Sibling Needs Over Time

Sibling experiences evolve with age. Keep adjusting your support:

| Age | What They Might Need |
|-----|----------------------|
| Preschool | Simple explanations, comfort when confused or scared |
| Elementary | Space to ask questions, reassurance they’re not responsible |
| Tween | Honest conversations, private time, validation for all feelings |
| Teen | Identity space, trusted adult to vent to, freedom to define boundaries |
| Young Adult | Discussions about future roles, long-term support planning, autonomy |

---

## 🧠 SECTION 8: Support for Neurodivergent Siblings

Some siblings may have ADHD, anxiety, or other support needs too.

- Don’t assume they can always self-regulate because they “talk more.”
- Validate that their challenges are real—even if they look different.
- Make space for *both* kids to have accommodations and care.

Suggested Phrase:
> “Just because your challenges are invisible doesn’t make them any less important.”

| “I’m scared about the future.” | Calm conversations about what will (and won’t) be expected of them |

💙 Final Reminder:
Siblings don’t just witness autism—they carry part of its emotional weight.  
The more we see them, the less they have to disappear.

Supporting siblings is not an extra. It’s a revolution in how we care for the whole family.
