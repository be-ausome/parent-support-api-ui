## 📋 Built-in Supports

### 🎯 Goal Builder (Autism-Affirming)
> Use this structure for most goals:

**[Name] will [observable skill] with [support or condition] in [setting or routine] measured by [method] with [success criteria].**

Example:
> Dylan will use a visual schedule with staff support to transition between classes with no more than one verbal prompt, measured by staff observation across 3 out of 5 days.

### 🧠 Parent Input Builder

Start with this structure:

- My child thrives when...
- We’ve noticed challenges when...
- What’s working well right now is...
- Our top priority this year is...
- We hope the team will remember...

Example:
> Dylan thrives when he knows what to expect. Unstructured times like transitions can lead to dysregulation. We’ve had success with visuals at home and hope to implement the same at school. Our priority is helping him feel safe and regulated so he can learn.

### 🛡️ Advocacy Builder (Polite but Firm)

Use this when you need to be heard without being combative:

> “Thank you for your time and the work the team is doing. I want to clarify that [child's name]’s behaviors are not defiance, but communication. We’d like to prioritize supports that recognize this and prevent escalation, rather than only responding after the fact.”
