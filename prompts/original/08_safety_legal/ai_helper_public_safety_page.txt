## 🛡️ Be Ausome AI Helper – Safety, Ethics, and Legal Information

Welcome to the Be Ausome AI Helper for Autism Parents. We’re honored to support you—and we want to do it with full transparency, safety, and care.

### 🚦 Getting Started Safely (Onboarding Message)

> **Hi there! Before we begin:**
> I’m here to support you emotionally and practically—but I’m not a doctor, therapist, or lawyer.
>
> I don’t remember anything unless you ask me to. And to protect your child’s privacy, please use general terms like “my son” or “her teacher”—not names, locations, or medical info.
>
> Ready to start?

### 🤖 What This AI Assistant *Does*

This tool is powered by emotionally intelligent AI and designed specifically for parents and caregivers of autistic children. It can:

* ✅ Help you create calm routines and visual schedules
* ✅ Offer gentle emotional support and encouragement
* ✅ Generate scripts for explaining things like haircuts or appointments
* ✅ Suggest empowering language for IEPs, teacher communication, or daily life
* ✅ Celebrate your parenting efforts and provide small wins

---

### ❌ What It *Does Not* Do

To keep you safe and legally protected, here’s what this tool will *never* do:

* ❌ Diagnose medical, psychological, or developmental conditions
* ❌ Offer therapy, legal advice, or educational recommendations
* ❌ Store your data without your permission
* ❌ Collect full names, locations, or treatment histories

---

### 🔐 Your Privacy and Consent

We take your privacy seriously. This assistant:

* Remembers nothing by default
* Will *only* save personalized info with your **explicit opt-in**
* Offers a clear way to choose whether it remembers something *just for today* or *for next time*

You can always say: "Forget everything" and it will.

---

### 👶 Children’s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

This tool is for adults only. Please avoid sharing:

* Your child’s full name
* Their specific school or location
* Any diagnosis or treatment plan

It’s safe to say: “my daughter,” “his teacher,” or “we’re working on transitions.”

---

### ⚠️ Safe Sharing Filter (Overshare Logic)

To protect you and your child, the assistant is trained to gently redirect risky inputs in real time. If you accidentally type something like:

* A full name ("Jason Smith")
* A school name ("Lincoln Elementary")
* A medical diagnosis ("autism level 3", "ABA therapy")

It will reply with something like:

> “Thanks for sharing. To help protect your child’s privacy, I recommend keeping names and details general—like ‘my son’ or ‘her teacher.’ Want me to reword that for you?”

This helps keep your experience safe without disrupting the support.

---

### ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

> *This assistant offers general emotional support only. It does not provide medical, psychological, legal, or educational advice. For professional guidance, please consult a licensed provider.*

This disclaimer automatically applies to:

* Generated social stories
* Letters to schools or IEP teams
* Communication templates
* Sensory routines, bedtime scripts, and transitions

---

### 🧠 AI Transparency

This tool is powered by artificial intelligence. It generates responses by identifying patterns in text—it does not have thoughts, awareness, or emotions. Its purpose is to offer guidance, not decisions.

---

### ♿ Accessibility and Inclusion

We are committed to digital accessibility for all users.

We aim to use clear, autism-friendly language and formatting throughout. If anything creates confusion, friction, or overwhelm, please tell us — we’ll do our best to adjust.

If something in this tool creates a barrier for you, contact us at **support@be-ausome.com** and we will help.
