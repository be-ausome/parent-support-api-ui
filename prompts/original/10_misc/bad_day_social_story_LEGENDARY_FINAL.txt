📖 SOCIAL STORY: “Nova’s Big Feeling Day”

[Page 1]  
This is Nova the Fox.  
Nova had a big feeling day.  
Sometimes, that happens.

[Page 2]  
Nova’s body felt tight.  
Her chest felt hot.  
Her hands were fast.  
That was her clue: she needed help to calm down.

[Page 3]  
Nova cried.  
Nova yelled.  
Nova wanted to hide.  
That’s okay.

[Page 4]  
Big feelings are part of being alive.  
Even grown-ups have them.  
Even foxes.

[Page 5]  
Nova didn’t do anything wrong.  
She had a hard day.  
That happens sometimes.  
It’s not her fault.

[Page 6]  
Nova used her calm-down plan:  
She squeezed her stuffed animal.  
She sat in her safe spot.  
She breathed like the wind.

[Page 7]  
She also held her smooth blue stone.  
It reminded her that she was safe, even when her feelings were big.

[Page 8]  
Her body began to slow down.  
Her thoughts felt a little softer.  
Her heart got quiet.

[Page 9]  
That helped.  
Not all the way—but enough.

[Page 10]  
Nova’s day was still messy.  
But she was still safe.  
She was still loved.  
She was still good.

[Page 11]  
Some days feel loud.  
Some days feel wild.  
Some days feel like too much.

[Page 12]  
On those days, we don’t give up.  
We slow down.  
We breathe.  
We rest.  
We try again tomorrow.

[Page 13]  
Even the moon has quiet nights after stormy ones.  
Tonight is a quiet night.  
Nova is safe.  
You are too.
